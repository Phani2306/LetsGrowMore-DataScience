# LetsGrowMore-DataScience
This repository contains four diverse data science projects that showcase a range of skills in data analysis, machine learning, and image processing. Each project is designed to provide practical insights and hands-on experience in solving real-world problems.

#Projects
# 1. Iris Flower Classification
Build a classification model to categorize iris flowers based on their features using machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

# 2. Music Recommendation System
Develop a personalized music recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques to suggest relevant songs to users based on their preferences and historical interactions.

# 3. Stock Price Prediction
Create a predictive model to forecast stock prices by analyzing historical stock data, applying time series analysis, and implementing machine learning algorithms like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.

# 4. Image to Pencil Sketch
Implement an image processing algorithm to convert color images into pencil sketches, exploring techniques like edge detection and contrast manipulation.
